This add-on allows you to link tags with decks such that when adding notes in the Add screen, the tag field will be automatically populated with the configured tags of the chosen deck.

Tags can be configured from the "Linked Tags" menu item under the gears icon in the main screen.

Written specifically for 2.1.35. Support for newer versions may be added in the future.
